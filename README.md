# Javascript-Python Chatbot

*In this repository you have a **Chatbot** with `html/css` GUI.*

### Description

\- In this **Repository** you have a chatbot that has a Graphical User Interface with the help of html/css.

In particular, I used `Python/Tensorflow` to train the Chatbot and used `html/css` in order to make the web app. 

The communication between Python and Js is being made with the help of `Flask`.

## What needs to be done:

1. Train the Chatbot.
 1. Create a dataset.
 2. Process the dataset.
 3. Train the `Model`.
 4. Create the `API.`
2. Make the Web Application.
 1. Design the Application.
 2. Implement the Design.
 3. Make the Communication between **Front and backend**.
 4. Display the backend answer.

## What technologies were used

#### For the python-backend:
1. Tensorflow/Keras
2. NLTK
3. flask
4. numpy/pickle

#### For the front-end:

1. html/css
2. Javascript



## How to set it up 

#### Start python-server
First of all you need to start the `python` server. Open a **command-prompt** in the chatbot folder and type:
```bash
python backend
``` 
*- This will automatically start the server.*

#### Start index.html

After that open the `index.html` file inside the frontend and start chatting with your new friend. *:P*

## Conclusion

This was a small Project that helped me with ml and the communication between `python/js` .
